My map uses several different zoom functions. The first of which is at the outermost zoom and it 
shows each state with the golden arches as the symbol. This is just to notify the viewer that they
are looking at a map of McDonald locations. At this level and sizing of points whould be unnoticable.
As you zoom in it shows the number of McDonalds for each state and as you zoom in further is shows
each location as an individual point. The compositing operation is setting the line-comp-op to
color-dodge for the border lines allowing the border to brighten the color of the county. The
color scheme is reds, yellows, and oranges which is McDonalds colors. The labels show how many 
McDonalds are in each state (at state level zoom). The pllygons have been given appropriate colors
and the borders (lines) styles appropriatly to match the rest of the scheme. I feel that all of
these choices help to convey that McDonalds locations are being displayed while still being easily
readable and pleasing.
