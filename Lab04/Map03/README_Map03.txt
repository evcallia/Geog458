My map is intended to show the viewer exactly where the top three locations to visit in Seattle are (according to the trip advisor website listing the top things to do in Seattle). It does this in multiple ways. When zoomed out to the world view it shows the United States as a light blue color, drawing attention to the U.S. As you zoom in it highlights Washington as a light green, again, drawing attention. It also symbolizes the locations of the data with a point so the user knows there are points there. As the user zooms in further, the highlighting goes away to reveal a map of Seattle including everything from lakes to schools and roads. This is important becasue depending on what was scraped from trip advisor, the destinations could be anything. All the layers included fill the map with everything the user may need to know in order locate the points. It includes roadways (with street names)for driving and walkways for walking. The user could essentially just zoom in to where they were (as long as they're in Seattle) and follow the paths to their chosen destination. The color schemes I used are all sequential. For example, small roads are a light yellow, medium roads a little darker, and highways a light orange. This makes it easy for the user to understand what is what and what is related to each other. Once I had the appropriate schemas I tinkered with the percise colors. I decided to go with lighter colors for almost everything except the building which I wanted to pop a little more. This is because, although the user could use the map as a way to navigate, it is intended just to show the user exactly where the landmark is. I found that lighter colors were less distracting and I was able to focus more on the point rather than everything around it. This map contains many different zoom levels that are vital to showing were these locations are. The first is just drawing attention to Washington, but as you move closer, landuse and roadways appear just giving a general location of things. Even closer reveals all the building which is the most important part since this is what we are trying to locate. The pin-heads are also scaled to appropriate sizes at each zoom level.
