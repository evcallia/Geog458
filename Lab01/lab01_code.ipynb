    "Problem 1:\n",
    "For each county in Washington, create a GeoJSON file whose filename is the county name and whose contents are the polygons for the block groups within that county. This means that you will end up with as many GeoJSON files as there are counties in WA. Each such file should be named after a county and contain only the block groups from that county.\n",

    "Problem 2:\n",
    "Print out a ranked list, in descending order, of the ten largest total populations in 2013 of counties in Washington, according to this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: The jsonOutput method takes 7 perameters which allow for the user to specify which files to use, and the names of the fields to use for each file. The approach is to first creat the geojson files. To do this all records of a particular county were selected using a sql expression. From there a new shapefile was created for each county containing all the blocks for that county. The OSGeo4W was then called to convert these shapefiles to geojson files. The approach for ordering the top 10 counties in descending order is to first create a total population field. Then go through the shapefiles for each county (created above) and calculate the total population. The population was then added to the countynames file and sorted. From there the top 10 were printed."
